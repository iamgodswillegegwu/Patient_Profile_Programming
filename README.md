# Patient_Profile_Programming
Patient profile is a list of data collected about individual subjects participating in clinical trials. It can contain all, most or only part of the data. It can be expressed in the narrative, summarized in English, or it can be just a simple data dump. All patient profiles require a patient profile specification document which helps to determine how the output of the SAS Program should look like.  In this project, I am using SAS Code to fetch data from EDC listings and Map with a patient profile specification to produce colorized tables using SAS ODS, Proc Report, Proc Transpose, among others.  Kindly feel free to contribute to this program if you have the skills.
